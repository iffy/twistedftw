<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

<p>
    Here is some code you can run to make sure you have Twisted installed correctly.  Start a python console session (by typing <code>python</code> in your terminal) then paste the following in the console:

<!-- runcode hello -->
<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">from twisted.internet.task import react, deferLater

def printMessage():
    print 'Hello, world!'

def main(reactor):
    return deferLater(reactor, 1, printMessage)

react(main)</pre>

The program will wait 1 second, print <code>Hello, world!</code>, then exit with exit code 0.
</p>
