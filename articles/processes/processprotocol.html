<h1>Process interaction</h1>

<p>
  Twisted lets you interact with processes <em>while they run</em>!

<h2>Guessing game</h2>

<p>
  Here's the code for a guessing game:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-py" include="./txftw/processes/guessinggame.py"></pre>

<p>
  And here's a program that will spawn and play the game:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-py" include="./txftw/processes/guessingplayer.py"></pre>

<p>
  The strategy <code>RandomGamePlayer</code> uses isn't very good (it randomly chooses a number in the range until it guesses right, completely ignoring the 'too high' and 'too low' cues).  See if you can modify the player to take advantage of the cues.
